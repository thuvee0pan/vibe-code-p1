## Getting started

This is a minimal React + Vite app with a single responsive landing page that says “Come On board”.

### Run locally

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will open on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Build for production

npm run build
npm run preview
```
